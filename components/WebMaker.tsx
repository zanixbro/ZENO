// This file should no longer exist, its content was moved to components/CodeBlock.tsx and the page/WebMaker.tsx version was updated.
// This is a placeholder for the changes required to WebMaker.tsx, which is split for readability.
// The actual changes to WebMaker.tsx will be included in its own change block.
// The `CodeBlock` component is assumed to be moved to a shared location, like `components/CodeBlock.tsx`.
// This is part of a larger change and only represents the original file before splitting the CodeBlock.
// The full content for pages/WebMaker.tsx will be provided in a later change block.
// No actual changes to THIS file (components/WebMaker.tsx) in this step.
